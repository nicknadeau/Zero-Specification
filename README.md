# Zero Specification
The specification for the Zero generic blockchain template layer. Zero is intended to provide a generic base layer of functionality, enabling various types of different blockchains to be built on top of it.

The specification is written in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/).

__WARNING:__ Zero is still version 0 because there is no substantial layer one protocol built on top of any implementation of it yet, and I refuse to solidify the specification to v1 until I have done some dog-fooding of my own and am convinced it meets the requirements of a real and comprehensive use-case. I am currently working on that implementation, but I don't expect it to materialize any time soon. Until then, this specification should still be considered experimental and still subject to change.
